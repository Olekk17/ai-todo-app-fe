This is a fully working todo app created using React.js with TS. Uses this API - https://github.com/Olekk17/ai-todo-app-be. OpenAI API usage and auth is implemented on the BE side. 

Be patient. BE is hosted on render.com with a FREE plan, which shuts down the instance after 10-15 minutes of inactivity.
